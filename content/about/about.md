### Background
With over two decades of experience at the intersection of leadership, risk management, and cybersecurity, I've had the privilege of navigating the high-stakes world of national security. My journey as a counterintelligence special agent has been nothing short of exhilarating, filled with complex national security investigations, cutting-edge technical threat research, and the relentless pursuit of safeguarding our nation's most sensitive assets.

In my various roles, I've orchestrated comprehensive threat and cyber intelligence operations, and led red team engagements that mimic real-world attack scenarios to expose vulnerabilities and bolster security. My expertise in detecting and neutralizing insider threats has proven crucial in maintaining the sanctity of critical infrastructures and organizational assets.

My passion for cybersecurity extends beyond hands-on experience; my academic background has equipped me with a deep understanding of the latest technologies and strategies. I thrive on staying ahead of the curve, continually expanding my knowledge to tackle the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Collaboration is at the heart of what I do. Whether guiding cross-functional teams, leading intricate investigations, or advising on strategic security initiatives, I am dedicated to delivering innovative and proactive security solutions that not only protect but also empower organizations and our nation.
