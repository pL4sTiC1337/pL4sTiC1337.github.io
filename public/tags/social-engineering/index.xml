      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where cyber threats dominate headlines, physical security is often overlooked. However, one of the most effective tools in an attacker’s arsenal isn’t a zero-day exploit or advanced malware—it’s human nature.

Attackers leverage this psychological tendency to manipulate employees into bypassing security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
