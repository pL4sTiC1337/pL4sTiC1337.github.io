      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With over two decades of experience at the intersection of leadership, risk management, and cybersecurity, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of navigating the high-stakes world of national security. My journey as a counterintelligence special agent has been nothing short of exhilarating, filled with complex national security investigations, cutting-edge technical threat research, and the relentless pursuit of safeguarding our nation&amp;rsquo;s most sensitive assets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my various roles, I&amp;rsquo;ve orchestrated comprehensive threat and cyber intelligence operations, and led red team engagements that mimic real-world attack scenarios to expose vulnerabilities and bolster security. My expertise in detecting and neutralizing insider threats has proven crucial in maintaining the sanctity of critical infrastructures and organizational assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
